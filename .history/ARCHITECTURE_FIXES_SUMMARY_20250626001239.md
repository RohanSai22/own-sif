# Prometheus 2.0 - Critical Architecture Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes

### 1. **Population-Based Darwinian Evolution** 
- **Issue**: System was using single-agent evolution instead of true population-based evolution
- **Fix**: Refactored `main.py` to implement proper population-based evolution:
  - Added population management attributes (`population`, `population_scores`, `generation`)
  - Implemented `_initialize_population()` method for seeding from archive or creating genesis agents
  - Implemented `_evaluate_population()` for parallel evaluation of all population members
  - Implemented `_select_parents()` using tournament selection
  - Implemented `_crossover_and_mutate()` for creating next generation with elitism
  - Implemented `_archive_population()` for archiving entire generations
  - Modified evolution loop to work with populations instead of single agents

### 2. **Web Search Integration in Self-Improvement**
- **Issue**: Agent's `_research_improvements` was hardcoded, not using web search as described in prompts
- **Fix**: Completely refactored `agent/agent_core.py:_research_improvements()`:
  - Uses LLM to generate focused search queries based on identified weaknesses
  - Executes web searches via `tool_manager.execute_tool("web_search")`
  - Synthesizes research findings using LLM for actionable recommendations
  - Falls back to internal analysis if web search fails
  - Now matches the self-reflection prompt's instructions

### 3. **Robust Archive Loading**
- **Issue**: Archive loading broke when `mutation_changes` was renamed to `mutations_applied`
- **Fix**: Enhanced `archive/agent_archive.py:_load_archive()`:
  - Handles both field names (`mutations_applied` and `mutation_changes`) for backward compatibility
  - Added robust datetime parsing with fallback to current time
  - Added missing field validation with sensible defaults
  - Improved error handling for corrupted or incomplete generation files

### 4. **Archive Pruning Integration**
- **Issue**: `prune_archive` existed but was never called from main evolution loop
- **Fix**: Added periodic archive pruning in `main.py`:
  - Calls `prune_archive(max_generations=50)` every 10 generations
  - Prevents archive from growing unbounded
  - Maintains best-performing lineages while removing poor performers

### 5. **Enhanced Patch Extraction**
- **Issue**: Patch extraction from agent solutions was simplistic and fragile
- **Fix**: Completely rewrote `evaluation/swe_bench_harness.py:_extract_patch_from_solution()`:
  - Added support for explicit `<patch>` tags (recommended format)
  - Improved diff block detection with better regex patterns
  - Added fallback extraction from code blocks
  - Added diff content validation
  - Added last-resort diff pattern matching
  - Much more robust for various patch formats agents might generate

### 6. **Improved Docker Environment**
- **Issue**: Docker environments were brittle for many SWE-bench tasks
- **Fix**: Enhanced `evaluation/sandbox.py:_generate_dockerfile()`:
  - Implemented true multi-stage build for better dependency handling
  - Added comprehensive system dependency installation
  - Added Python compatibility fixes for legacy repositories
  - Added multiple installation fallbacks (pyproject.toml ‚Üí setup.py ‚Üí develop)
  - Added proper environment variable setup (PYTHONPATH, etc.)
  - Added better error handling and logging
  - Added support for various requirements file formats

### 7. **Live GUI Integration**
- **Issue**: GUI was not live - it loaded its own separate state instead of backend data
- **Fix**: Implemented live state sharing:
  - Added `_write_live_state()` method in `main.py` to write JSON state file
  - State includes: generation, population info, scores, status, timestamps
  - Modified `gui_dashboard.py:refresh_data()` to read live state file
  - GUI now shows real-time population evolution data
  - State file updated at key points in evolution loop

## üîß Configuration Alignment
- **Issue**: `config.py` had `population_size = 5` but main.py ignored it
- **Fix**: All population-based code now respects `config.population_size`

## üìä Verification
Created comprehensive test suite (`test_architecture_fixes.py`) that verifies:
- ‚úÖ Population-based evolution implementation
- ‚úÖ Web search integration in research 
- ‚úÖ Robust archive loading with backward compatibility
- ‚úÖ Enhanced patch extraction with multiple format support
- ‚úÖ Live state integration for GUI
- ‚úÖ Docker improvements with multi-stage builds

All tests pass successfully!

## üöÄ Impact
These fixes transform Prometheus 2.0 from a single-agent system with several architectural flaws into a true population-based Darwinian evolution system that:

1. **Evolves populations** instead of single lineages (as designed)
2. **Uses web search** for research as intended by the prompts
3. **Loads archives robustly** without breaking on field name changes
4. **Extracts patches reliably** from various agent solution formats
5. **Runs evaluations robustly** in improved Docker environments
6. **Provides live feedback** to the GUI dashboard
7. **Manages archive size** automatically through pruning

The system now truly implements the "Observable Darwinian G√∂deli Machine" architecture as intended.

## üìù Files Modified
- `main.py` - Population-based evolution, live state, archive pruning
- `agent/agent_core.py` - Web search integration in self-improvement
- `archive/agent_archive.py` - Robust loading with backward compatibility  
- `evaluation/swe_bench_harness.py` - Enhanced patch extraction
- `evaluation/sandbox.py` - Improved Docker generation
- `gui_dashboard.py` - Live state integration
- `test_architecture_fixes.py` - Verification test suite (new)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing archives will load correctly
- Configuration settings are now properly respected
- Error handling has been significantly improved
- The system is much more robust for real-world usage
